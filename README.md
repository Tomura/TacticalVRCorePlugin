# TacticalVRCorePlugin
Unreal Engine 4 (and in the future probably 5) plugin for implementing a VR Shooter. Follow the instructions to setup configs, etc accordingly to be able to use this plugin.

# Installation
Put the plugin into your projects Plugin directory and activate it via the editor. Please make sure to read the wiki, about the necessary config options, or alternatively modify the plugin source code to fit your configuration.

# Contributions
I appreciate contributions via pull requests. This plugin is developed in conjunction with my own hobby VR project, so please understand that I may reject pull requests, that do not fit into my overall vision. Even little things helps, such as writing additional docstrings, etc.
